Thank you.; Limiter. Not limitator. Sorry; The Royce (as aficionados call it) is, perhaps, the second most iconic car in the world.  The most iconic isn't Bugatti or Ferrari, but Bentley.  You see, it's all to do with the concept of "old money": nouveaux riches and parvenus may wax priapic over the Spirit of Ecstasy, but it's often considered flashy, ostentatious, social proof that one has made it.  Old money has no such desire, merely a desire to enjoy the luxuries their wealth affords rather than rubbing the plebs' noses in something they can never afford.  Also, because it's often adorned by wedding silk by the carriage trade, its pristine whiteness is somewhat stained.

Bentleys, on the other hand, have the quality without the extrovert nature, and so can be enjoyed with a meaningful enough lack of one-upmanship not to get some ne'er-do-well yobbo signing his name with a key in the paintwork.; the brits had a sub that could do 400mph in the 1930s.; From what I've read, the Rolls Royce is probably the most quiet vehicle in which to ride.

A real car is something along the lines of the BMW E30 M3 (which is a legend in track racing) or the legendary Audi S1 Quattro. And the people driving RRs? Mostly people who have too much money.

Dress in casual attire, the salesman mocked at him and said he would not be able to afford it and to stop wasting their time. The salesman didn’t knew that the “shabby” Indian was the Maharaja of Alwar, King Jai Singh. He Came back to his place in a bad mood.
The infuriated King, Jai Singh went back to the dealership. He collected his wits together and asked for manager, disclosed his identity and ordered all the 7 cars that were present on the showroom floors. He also asked the dealership manager to send that arrogant salesman to personally deliver the cars to his palace in India.
Maharaja Jai Singh ordered to cut open their roofs and began to use them as garbage collectors.
Soon after the Rolls Royce company received the news of their brand being humiliated this way, the salesman was fired and the company sent a telegram carrying an official apology at Maharaja’s palace in Alwar.
Also imploring him to take the garbage collecting cars off service. Also, Rolls Royce offered him seven new cars for no cost.

And it wasn't 450mph. 

That is some bad material research you've got there.; Little advice cut the intro its really tacky just start it around your 28 sec and cut before; Are we sure about the story concerning Jai Singh?  I ask because seems like what articles i find on the net about it all wind up pointing to a single picture of a Rolls with small brooms tied in place in front of the front tires.  One of the sites point out those brooms would be placed like that to protect the tires instead of sweeping any street.  Also the picture in question has the headlights of the car away from the middle of the car while the 1920 models, the headlights were in front of the grill.  edit: The sited picture is confirmed on another site to be a 1934 Ford Tudor Sedan.

The other reason I mention this is because I'm from New York City and we used to tell a story about Reggie Jackson in a similar position right after he signed his contract with the Yankees.  He wound up getting a high end vehicle, driving it into the middle of the outfield at Yankee Stadium after being turned away the first time and taking batting practice using the vehicle as a target.

They said the car from the 1930s was faster than a modern car. I'm saying it had A FUCKING PLANE ENGINE IN IT! Put a plane engine in anything and it'll go faster than a Bugatti.; +SeanTheHOMIE Actually, if you put a plane engine to something nowadays that is not built specially for that purpose, the whole machine will either crash, blow up, start to fly or catch fire.

Also, no matter what you'd do to a car to make it faster than the Bugatti, the Bugatti would still be the fastest road-legal PRODUCTION car in world.

There are faster land vehicles than Bugatti since forever but none of them are exactly road-legal in first place or even produced in more numbers than a single or two prototypes just for the purpose of beating the record.

The first problem about a jet engine in a car is the fact there are laws about brake power required, that car wouldn't be able to stop no matter how big or hi-tech brakes it would have, laws of physics makes it impossible, ever wondered why in drag racing they use a parachute to stop the car? that's exactly why, there's a limited space to brake inside and the brakes are not powerful enough to stop the car in time.; You're absolutely right on all of your points. However, I didn't mean literally drop a plane engine in a car, everything takes testing to get right.

Bugatti does make the fastest production car, but that wasn't part of my argument. So you point is invalid.

Do some research, there are road legal jet cars. Again, not part of my argument, invalid.

One gas engine, two solid rear axle, nothing like the one that will go anywhere and knowing a guy who owned both his son went to the training with the h1 banged up skid pan underneath bad but drove there and back.  H2 snapped front drive shafts and broke left rear axle had to be towed home.  So the diesel go anywhere humvee hell I want one.  The other two just don't stand up like the original.  The made a suv for the road the first one was for anywhere. ; Not a hummer hater just look at the original humvee (not hummer when gm got the rights they changed the name) the hummer is a differant on top of a tohoe chassis live rear axle not independent, not a gear over hub design direct drive if you look at a humvee the drive shafts gos in above the hub has a gear drive in wheel,  the h1 was a diesel work horse the h2 and 3 are gas drinking tahoes.  the hummer no frame (that I seen looked like a uni body design)  h2 frame from a 1500 pickup.  so yes what your looking at the body panels and insides are hummer.  the heart or guts is chevy pickup and suv.  also have you rode in a h1 there is no luxury they give you alright seats and a radio about all from military.  so that's how without the swearing (or a lauding to swearing).the humvee was a great vehicle till gm got there hands on it.; Oh and also dvin.  if you read the h1 I'm totally behind would like a H1 or a military humvee.  the H2,H3 and that H3 pickup (think I just throw up in my mouth what was gm thinking?); that is a question i would like to know the answer to; Probably Toyotas and shit.

The highest alleged speed that has been obtained for a submarine when it comes to its Vx, horizontal velocity at a given height, is around 51.4 mph. 400 is impossible and will be impossible for decades if not centuries due to fluid mechanics.
