brackeys moment🔥; 1000th comment; 2:29 which game is this ?
6:07; Sigma; 2:10 or... idle games 🤣 (jk, mostly); I'm still confused with the basic process and pipeline workflows. 
1) Building assets in Blender (and animate them) and import it in Unreal - already feels overwhelming
2) Optimizing procedures. Are there specific rules. Do I put 15 houses on 1 atlas texture map, or each house have their own atlas texture map? In most games you will see a massive amount of topology work on a building, but when I do this there is no ram to put anything of this kind in Unreal. 
No idea how some AAA games have tons of detail there in once space, but when I do it, everything loads in. For example, in GTA or RDR you see buildings in the distance (even at low level of detail, but when I do it via level streaming, there is nothing in the distance until things pop in via parameter settings. Or for example in Cyberpunk, a room filled with 200 props and nothing gets load in? It just doesn't make sense.
3) The basic structure of levels. From a Menu to character creation to Level 1 (island), level 2 is a sandbox, sub-levels with cave/dungeons, level 4 is inside castle with tons of rooms. (for example) < ---- no idea how to structure any of this if in a logic format / hierarchy. And I can't find any tutorial explaining this.  
4) Unreal can become quickly like rocket science, if you are like me (that didn't study coding/programming).; My opinion is that it's easier to code in unreal engine than in c# ,there and a comma if you forget it, the code no longer works...; I have played all Half-Life games but finished none. Last week I decided  to finally re-play all of them, to the end this time. I have spent years without getting spoilers to the end scenes of them. Till now...; Wow you really cant say the word bomb who is youtube trying to protect, lil timmy who is afraid of monsters underneath his bed; this is the most boring video ever; Are you gay? At the ending scene it seems like you are!; Thanks; I prefer the 3 Gs of GTA. Grab, Get in, Go. Simple game design.; I think some AAA games could learn a lot from this…😂; For those who never heard and for those who wanna share it.

HERE IS THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you; By the way thanx for info; That's funny about pineapple hehe; Long intro and slight accent; What I learnt is... in CSGO, you plant pineapples! 😂; And everybody following similar formulas leads to to all games becoming boring. Cut scene, mission, repeat.; Then why'd you comment?; Pineapple?; Coding your own games is easier than you think... skip ad; Really helpful especially for beginners.; Pineapple 😂😂😂; own; Game assets design

??; Link to the paper seems broken..; pretty sure you can say "bomb" on youtube 🙄; we miss you Brackeys ...; 👏👍; Good; Link to structural composition doesn't work.; Fantastic; I love coding game; 3:20 please someone tell which game is this?; But it's okay if I can be a game designer someday and nothing to worry, that's all; Coding a game is such a headache when you're a noob.; best 9 minutes I ever spent; Thanks for your video! 😃; what is the name of the game at 3:57 ?; I really miss this legend; time wasted; Wow def a video abt game design and not ur watch hours :D; U really like Half life huh; DOOM?;  @alextrixVZ  yes it was doom, thanks; Does anyone know what game it is at 4:10 ??; One thing I've always been puzzled about and I could never find good info about is how to create units and how to balance them for a game: For example: a game that has a powerful but slow fighter vs a long ranged fragile one and a fast but also fragile one, etc. One with gimmicks, like minelaying, healing, fixing, etc, and how to balance these things well. To really begin with, how to choose the atributes for the units and what to avoid... That's pretty hard...; I have absolutely nothing to code with but I'm really curious; thanks for the intersting information; When I see new game, My thought, “ New splash art to draw” ,💸💰what else should I do, I’m an artist.; 8:27 PRECIOUS~!!!!! SO CUTEEEE UWU; This is a fantastic video! I make Augmented Reality game/app tutorials and I have one on Game Design Theory that covers how to think about hero shots and then how to come up with the breakdown for them. Come through <3 Hopefully you can learn as much from it as you did from this one.; 1:44 I know it was just an expression, but pillars don't hold foundations.
Sorry, my engineering brain just had to get that out of my system. Proceed.; 8:30 gay; K so you see my friend is a indie game developer and he wants me to work as his game designer but i have no background so i was gonna say no until…… he said there was a salary then i said yes i would like to take on the positions and here we are; The Pineapples.... LOL; Testes meant....

You gotta test that game everytime you add something... Cause it probably won't work the first time or the second time or maybe even third time... In fact sometimes it's the last thing you try.. Which is actually a given when you think about it...; OMG!!! IT'S A BOOOOMMMBBB; if i make something somewhat playable, and maybe even (big emphasis on the maybe) fun, i will thank this video; I’ve been Thinking Of Making Another Smash Game Myself By Adding More New and Returning Characters and Returning and New Stages and New Musics; I am creating a board game just like chess but 10x10 board and instead of chess pieces there will be boats/ships/torpedos/mines... And Idk how to draw those and also I wanna do a moving sea animation on board. I am fu*ked lol; very good; Warning- this video has ignored the fact that a single developer can't make witcher 3(just kidding) very informative video; At 6:49, Duck was the MVP for successfully planting the pineapple; So  the word "bomb" is forbidden on YouTube?; The Stanley Parables; Fantastic guide!; Me and my sister want to get into game design but she doesn't want to do the coding part of it. I was thinking that if I learn how to code then we could make our own games together lol; Oh I recently got pissed at a couple games I was looking forward to so yknow what, i'm making a game somehow; Kun app ho; pineapple's been planted!; 5:33 Brackeys? In this stone world?; Defina also has its own token, the $FINA Token, a BSC-based utility and governance token used throughout the Defina ecosystem and much more. #defina; a game designer is NOT 'the idea person' that sits around coming up with cool stuff
That's the first illusion that must be disspelled on the path of becoming a game designer :); Please tell me sir what price this course; good advice for any creating for market, it's not for you, you need to think outside "the" box, but you need a box, best way to get started is to pick a constraint of some sort; brackeys headpats is what we always needed but feared to ask for; Hi; A huge open world with stunning graphics won't be fun by itself. You'd need countless enjoyable mechanics to go with it... all needing to be prototyped.; Something to add to the appeal pillar: nostalgia; Come BAAAAAAAACK!; sir how about raylib? it seems nice but lack of tutorial; This is so nice! if you're looking for a card game with great graphic arts in it, you must try Lagim Card game. It is based on Filipino Folklore. You can check their facebook or instagram page.; if valve won't create half life 3 soon I'll do it myself; Bro with your English I didn't learn how  to create game but I learned english; I love video games and innovative ideas 
But recently due to addiction it is taking a bad turn; Did you check the description? :); True that! Working in a vacuum is tricky. Having constraints in one way or another is oddly very empowering in any creative field.;  @timdoesleveldesign  best example I can think of is when they say "say something funny" that'll put you in a more zen state than any meditation haha, but if they say "say something funny about..." you can usually use that as a platform to jump off of;  @jackp492  Great example! When creating layouts, I often like to start with a central area and flesh out a distinct visual element of it. 
Anything that follows from it will then have to make spacial and visual sense :);  @timdoesleveldesign  nice I had a pretty cool idea the other day, I plotted a story out using the top half shape of a Celtic crucifix, it was for a branching narrative story and you could start in 1 of 4 tribes of your choosing and the centre of the shape was going to be a giant tower of Babel thing where they are all enslaved, the intro cinematic was going to be the settlements of these tribes going about thier business as the shadow of the tower looms over each, that shape is useful for storyboarding stuff like that though, the idea is you could head straight for the tower or to the left to one tribe or to the right to another and basically navigate that shape while in game the map your navigating would be different, also while doing that I realised a really fun way to write npcs or characters in any story really is to come up with the character and all thier character things and motivations and what not, and then have your main plot and events and main character moments, and just kind of treat those side characters as being on autopilot doing thier own thing, it's fun to write as it can surprise you what you come up with as being the next logical action for them to take in the story based on thier character, and I've found the results make then feel a lot more lively and as if they have agency apart from the main character and events,  I think that's similar to what you mean, like you plant a seed and then just take it to its conclusion and the space in between kind of fills itself as you work on it, kind of like life really we know we were born and we know that it ends and we are given the freedom to fill in the middle, but we are still reacting to the other events and "characters" in the world and they are working on us;  @jackp492  Pretty much :)
Do you publish those stories anywhere?;  @timdoesleveldesign  haha no the work in progress is in my head, I've burnt every story I've ever written, I know that seems like sacrelige but it's very freeing, I'm getting a laptop with graphics card delivered tomorrow and I've just worked 2 months straight without a day off 12 hours a day, I'm taking two months off to learn to code and I have what I think could be the next rocket league which I'm gona prototype hopefully sell and then finance my game, how about you?;  @timdoesleveldesign  keep and eye out for serpentine systems Games, those will be mine;  @timdoesleveldesign  something I can recommend if you havnt read it is the bible, no story has ever been yearned for so much by the human heart, and once you've read it you'll see why and you'll see why there's churches everywhere, in a sense I think they kind of functioned like the first internet, or interweb anyway, and the amount of movies books and tv that reference it you'll be amazed how much it's gone over your head, just don't let anyone tell you what the book means that's where the craziness starts, and that's how we can have the perception of religion as Ned Flanders and somehow oxymoronically templar crusaders and Spanish inquisition;  @jackp492  Sounds great! Don't forget that not every project needs to be perfect. Try to finish some and get them out the door and make sure the next one is better :)

I've been working for a couple game companies for the last 9 years. Currently Senior Level Designer at Deep Silver. 
Gonna be moving into freelance work soon and hoping to make some interesting Youtube vids on the side!;  @timdoesleveldesign  cheers fella thanks for the advice, yeah I'm actually a construction labourer never went to uni or college if your American, but I've finally saved enough to give myself some time to produce, what games have you worked on?;  @timdoesleveldesign  actually better question, what kind of thing do you want to work gameplay style wise or storywise;  @jackp492  Worked on mostly First Person multiplayer stuff. Would love to work on a persistent world with a community driven aspect to it some day :);  @timdoesleveldesign  that sounds fun, something in the vein of those old Gmod role play servers? my single player game is kind of ancient world but the people the character has come from have gone nuts with harvesting the wind, not in that oasis game style, but I had a cool image in my brain of a kind of guerrilla force fighting with the wind behind them, deploying huge kites to screen them from missiles on thier approach before letting the wind take these huge canopies to envelope the enemies formation as they pile in, and alot of other gameplay and story ways kites can be used, there's a book I read as a kid called the kite rider, really good it's set in China about 6 or seven hundred years ago I think, and something about that kind of technology and flight is very humbling, like how fisherman talk romantically about the whims of the sea, left an impression me anyway;  @timdoesleveldesign  oh and the thing I like about that characterizing the sea or wind is, it is now a character and can be used in the story in some really fun subtle ways;  @jackp492  Oh, you should check out the Finish epic 'Kalevala' then if you haven't already. Elements of nature are commonly characterized in it :);  @timdoesleveldesign  ah nice we had all the moomins books growing up I'll have to check that out, those Finns spin a good yarn, I was also inspired by kite fighting my friend from karnataka told me about and how its a a game, yet in the movie city of God the kids don't play with kites for fun they use them as signals to the drug dealers a raid is coming or that a drop needs to be made, I think there's a movie about kite fighting set in afganistan too I'll probably get round to watching when I'm more in the mood to feel disappointed in humanity, I'm kidding but I'm not the glutton for seeking out the woes in the world, I've found I do better for myself and others looking for good things and sharing them;  @timdoesleveldesign  it's like an old epic ballad or something, thanks these are the kind of things it's so hard to find without a recommendation I'm gona enjoy this; The pinapple goes off and i get an ad for crackers (starting in pieces) making it seem like the pineapple was a cracker in disguise; 1:36 what game is this; Best video ever, thank you very much :D; 5:25 events occurring in game should follow physics.

Thank you for the great video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjoa7O0CdMs&t=2s; Greetings from turkey; the way I started my game dev jorney is when I was a little kid i was playing a game(IDK what game) and a thought ouccured to me,"games like this dont just come out of existese, so someone has to be making these games" so I lokked into and...YEAH,HERE I AM!!!; The article link seems not working ad giving security issues... my guess is the online magazine or whatever it was, has some serious problem.

I realize learning to code is not hard but figuring out what game I want to make and designing it is harder.; Same, I loved sandbox so I started game development; 2:49 HIM u mean him or her, jk I’m joking; Ah, but as he says right after, just keep it consistent! Most games deviate from physics one way or another, which is fine, as long as the player knows what to expect :); Sh1t don't feel the same when you're out of town; i don't like that overly smile, suspicious; I never thought I could I always thought I was more creative a add by idea in especially sport i would create what does not exist.; Come back!!!!!

I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  

It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” 

The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.

HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?

I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0

BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!

It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   

Thanks and God bless!

Main hard thing is engine - what takes your 3D model and manages all it's triangles, textures, collision, light, etc. That's why good engine costs millions! Practically impossible to write by loner.; true the art/aesthetic  is what sells not the mechanics; Game design is broken into steps just the same as any coding.; I have the exact opposite problem… I have lots of artistic ideas that I consider a solid 5/10 but I’ve got no coding experience.

Unsure if that’s what you meant though.; @k1ng_chicken  but tetris has a unique aesthetic and music;  @Girtharmstrong69  That is very true, the artistic aspect of it did indeed add to the marketing and overall feel of the game by a pretty large margin, but what makes the game fun is the gameplay, as you most likely know already. Without it, there would be no game and instead just a movie or something. I'm pretty sure tetris was mainly text based with falling blocks, but I am unsure.

Brackeys: Can i say the b- word?; I feel like these guidelines are just a collection of desing principles without any structure.
From what I've learned experiamcing games, any game is a theoretical machine, with the player  giving the input, which the game, through its processes turn into an entertaining output.
Making a long lasting gaming experiance is best achived when the interaction and hierarchy of these processes create the most number of possible outcomes that does not break the games internal logic.
Making a compelling game is establishing the games internal logic with enough twists that it feels new but not alien. Ofcourse there is eye-candy and ear-gasm, but it works on the same principle.
And lastly making a game that is playable depends on the input, the processes and the output work well together. Responsive and intuitive controls, non-crashing gamecode, output that follows the internal logic of the input in some way for the connection to be recognizable by the player.; The way he is smiling 100% of the time is kinda creepy -.-; 8:28 wait a minute; Is math required for game design; I started game design because of school; "Oh my god he just said "Bomb" I now feel the urge to explode" is this what youtube think could happen?; Hello all, Digiquest provides Bachelor's Degree in Gaming, Animation & VFX.

Stop complaining saying “I CaNt AfFoRd ThAt”, it isn’t really going to help anything. 

I am going to assume you around 14 so you can get a part time job really soon. When you get that job, wait a few months, boom, easy as that, you have the money for a PC. Next, watch some tutorials on game development and make some concepts.

I am really not sure if your drawings are actually good, just because your parents say they are good, no offense, but it doesn’t mean they are actually “good”. But, if you really are a great artist and you know how to code, soon enough, you’ll be releasing your first game (assuming you have enough time, you are not overwhelmed and a good learner).

Sorry if the reply was too long :);  @brrt1680  no it’s fine, I can’t really get a part time job yet bc In Uk where I am, u have to be 16 and your right, I am 14. But I will take your other advise, thanks; Mate, not to offend you or anything, but you don't need art for the necessary skill for a game designer.;  @newkiller4457  yeah u do🤨;  @HuskyBuscuit29  well, in a way if you want to animate the characters, then we'll I guess. My bad, I think I was looking too into it.;  @HuskyBuscuit29  I'm a game designer, and my art skills are beyond useless; good luck! can't wait to see what you make :D; To some posts pointing out: "just because your parents say you are good does not mean anything" yes, that is correct. But you are 14, you are young enough to learn any skill you want. There are people out who started learning drawing with 30+ besides having familiy and a full time job and they mastered it. You do not need to be born with a skill. Especially coding, which is to a huge proportion a knowledge-skill, can be learned and mastered without any talent you are born with. All you need is just enough interest in it to gain motivation to learn that skill on a regular basis. That's all. And of course equipement, but to begin with this skill you just need any kind of computer, even a < 100$ computer does this job.
I see you have an internet connection. So maybe you should checkout https://scratch.mit.edu , it's where I learned coding 13 years ago and you really need nothing but internet nowadays to use it.; Just a tip: Focus on finishing what you do. Instead of making one long 1 year project, make several different 1 month or week projects to expand your skills and use them in a different context.; Be a 3d artist or a concept art designer;  @HuskyBuscuit29  I’m studying Game Art at uni at the moment (first year) and it’s been really fun. First of all, you need to understand that a Game Designer is different to a Game Artist. A Game artist usually specialises in creating the 2D or 3D assets for a game while a designer comes up with the idea and puts it together through planning and research. Game art can be pretty complicated but the thing about game art is that you will constantly be learning, even as a professional. Best get a good computer or laptop and a mouse. If you want to be a 3D artist, try blender and other 3D modelling software. Learning to texture is also good! I would suggest looking through Artstation because many people within the industry post tutorials there! Constantly practise and learn more effiecient ways to do things. If you want to learn to code a game, there are plenty of websites that do free coding lessons, at least the basics. You’ll also need to download a game engine. I think unity is a good one to start with - the coding language for that is C#. Good luck, I wish you the best on your journey to doing game art!; how are ya? it's been 1 year.;  @TheDJboi2011  I’m good, how r u?;  @mr.p215  He's 14. The most important thing is if he likes it. If he does and spend a lot of time doing it, he will become great either way.;  @Bloodbone  your parents are always going to say your amazing at something, I’m older then him and my parents still say I’m amazing at every thing I do. I wouldn’t try get a job around drawing at the age of 14, i would probably wait until I was about 17 wheee by then you would be significantly better. It’s not as easy as it looks to get a job in drawing, in order to get payed any reasonably amount you need to be the best of the best. To get an idea of the quality I’m talking about search about concept art by Gavin Rothery or similar.;  @ykchloet  I'm going to college for game design for 1 year since it's free and hopefully I get a laptop in Christmas to do game design; watch some of my videos which ive been posting more and more lately--- they go through baby-steps through a lot of little things in the game dev pipeline! let me know if it is useful!;  @HuskyBuscuit29  Not really, depends on the game. I'm doing a game designer school right now and most teachers say you don't need to be good at drawing to be good at it, you need to have good ideas and put those ideas to good use, drawing is necessary for certain roles in game designing tho.; We need a update;  @rocketB343s  update: so I ended up going to college. I tried to get a game design course however failed maths so I had to retake maths in college. However, I took an art and design course instead and tried my best to do as much game related art going forward. I have finished college now and passed. Some of the art work I did was characters, backgrounds, posters, and for my final project I make a game case cover for ps5, Xbox and Nintendo switch for my own idea for a game which really brought my grade higher. The next step for me would be either go to university to now do a game design course now that I’ve have passed maths too. Or see if I can get working anywhere that need game illustrators. However I think for now, I’m just gonna get a steady job and sell art online, maybe see where that goes.;  @HuskyBuscuit29  GG/CONGRATULATION;  @rocketB343s  thank you.

It is one of the big MNC in videk game industry I won't take the name but the designers in my project were total DICK. I was kind of disappointed by it. My first issue with them was many of them absolutely had no idea about technical tools, animation and programming even many programmer on our project have an general idea about stuffs that they don't work on like Blenders/max and some other proprietary softwares for other stuffs. Anyway they issue here was there the knowledge gap created . Although nothing is impossible to implement for a programmer but you just cannot ask to make a certain design change when game is in masters or post beta . They would ask programmers/animators to make really big changes becasue their mind change i literally have to debate for hours telling how making certain change will be inconsistent with the current system. How we would have to request for mocaps then technical animators will work and only then programmers can implement the change they want. And there are clearly more obvious issues in game design which needs to be entertained but those designers to show how aesthetic they are tell programmers and animators to modify smallest details which i am not saying isn't important but there are other blockers you should resolve where technical team can advance. Also I know it is difficult to finalise all design aspects of game in early stages of the production but still they all are just not confirmed with the design they come up with and always programmers have  dead ends on local wiki or design documentation of game. Either post have partial information or inconsistent with other stuffs which designers should take care of when they make the document.; Spoiler from half life 2... ;(; MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT; What is game design?

In which you play and review free games.
Every gamer would love to watch it.; This is why Halo works so well (343i is of course debatable); the physics have rules and the AI behave in certain specific manner. If you learn these rules and behaviors, you will become extremely efficient at these games. 

I would say Doom is the same way regarding AI, but it lacks an intricate physics sandbox that Halo has (which I'm sure Eternal is moving into anyway.); Like it; https://youtu.be/YXwB1TuN-H8
FREE game devepment  course; Hideo Kojima should've watched this video before releasing Death Stranding ...; 1) download Chris Taylors game design doc template

Alternative: set up a local wiki server and build your gdd there.; get too real with weapons sounds and aggravate PTSD sufferers.   you do NOT want to trigger a fight or flight reflex.  that is not pretty and can lead to broken game machines or worse.; Good advices, but your folded collar triggers my OCD soooo hard :(; I like the three pillars.. I made 200 original games in the past 35 years. Possibly 30 I´d consider good ones. 
And it is very easy to think of exceptions. It might be part of the appeal not to communicate something clearly (for instance in a hacker game or an alice in wonderland game), the player might start thinking differently halfway through the game (or actually learn something), maybe this was what you intended etc etc.
Others say the holy grail of gamedesign is to get an emotional response from the player (any response, so hate or fear works too..) I have watched a flood of things people say about games, gamedesign etc appear. Even the vocation of game-designer and the seperation of design/art/development. 

I have yet to figure out one thing you can truly say for all games. Even for all games I made myself. Like most of these lists of rules for gamedesign, this is mostly true for most games. 
Still useful, because 9 out of 10 games you'll make, there is some truth in this. And it´s always good to know which rules you are breaking now. 

GameDesign has changed a lot in the last 35 years and one of the things that changed is that people overthink making games. It´s like with all the rules of fillm making. Great guidelines..  But follow them and you end up with something soulless, that might make you money, but...
 
Games just happened for me, most of the time. If I have one advice, it´s: be curious, be original,
 but don´t try to be original. If you can do that, you figured it out. 
If you are succesful, doing that.. that´s a nice bonus. I was moderately succesful for a while, but when I started to second guess myself, lots of the fun drained out of it. 
So take it from a hasbin :) Just make a few games and see where it leads you, then you can write a book about it later.; he did it all for a pat on the head.; Thanks Nordic CM Punk; Dude read that smiling in videos gives views and has taken it to an awkward level; Turns out the add was actually his own game...; secreates to designing like a boss!! fyi

..  manifest random buildings in architect program maya or modo... u only need 4 or 5. then u duplicate them all of the place in a bleacher stadiuim effect. 




then u u look at the random mess of buildings scattered in a bleacher effect and u visualize a scene from its randomness then u delete  the buildings that dont fit what u see in your head from the random mess youve made....


then you have made a foundation for a map in minutes and a dope concept that u cleaned up and brought out to life.




then u layer on top of it


over and over intell its really intricate looking




do that in a 360 degree manner and when your done u look back and have a full blown high powered map


. ps u layer lights walls. borders that block off poor design and cleans it up. easy stuff. dont over analize and follow my steps and you will save your self years of headachesssssss and will be a master in no time; thk you
Jesus loves you
Believe in him and repent; Halo presents systemic  gameplay very well, and Halo Infinite is not an exception to that. There are rules to movement, shooting and the physics. They are consistent in most cases, so player can rely on it as a tool to achieve their goal. I talked about systemic frameworks a lot, and many people seem to see it as scientific based interaction, like burning wood. But systemic gameplay is something is far bigger and is taking over the games industry right now. It is basically a ruleset in which the gameplay and world works consistently, so player do not mandatorily have to master the layout of the world, but the foundational rules of the world.; wow; Fixes his hair, doesn't fix his collar.; You give great tips and info that are worth so much more than the time you spend making them.

Saludos desde Chile :/; but bear in mind that brackeys is not a game dev, but a game dev tutorial creator. those "tips" are not even basics, but generalizations. i strongly suggest to either work on a bigger game, take game design lectures, or study game design books if you want to become a good game designer. 4 tips: 1) most game devs/artists do not know how to design games, which is due to specialization. the more you work in aaa and with very good game designers, the more humble you get. 2) secondly, watch your game list. what are you playing, and why? those game types/genres should be your first game. a major reason why almost all indie games are crap and fail is because the devs do not play those game types themselves. if you are not into your own game genre, you do not get the details, i.e. that make bf5 different to cod, right? or the difference between rimworld, prison architect and, uh, dwarf fortress. 3) a theme is not a game. a sci-fi game with aliens and spaceships is not a game, it is just a theme. a game has mechanics that work like a clockwork, that must by engaging, rewarding (or not), and fun. fun can be painful, hurting, disturbing, but it has to be fun. 4) do not listen to people that did not finish commercially successful games before. the last point is crucial. why did no man's sky fail? it did not fail in sales, but it failed in its potential and among fans. so, why? if you solve this question for everybody, you are a good game designer. if not, you are likely to fail. nms is a good example because everything mentioned in this video was there -- just not a good game design.; omg 60,000; Brackeys u are just Awesome !!
Can you please add a video about static batched, dynamic batched and GPU instanced  to build   Optimized Huge Maps ? ^_^; Please make a video on make games without coding; 5:53 - What game is this?; Hi,guys I have just published my first game on play store

if you want,you can support me!; Great video as usual!; waht is a junra !???; But even big projects need to prototype. Easier to fix a problem of bad mechanics in the beginning than fix it after a million lines of code has been written. Anyways, nice video. Great point about pacing.; What are brackeys Games?; Even though this has nothing to do with the video, I wanted to ask how I would make terrain in unity slippery.

I started developing my own Games(VR) with Unity since 2015-2016. I can completely agree. Developing Games is hard! . First games will not be developed in 2 weeks in GTA5 Quality. Months of work. of learning , of understanding is neccesarry to take small steps. You have to lear(if you are alone) : Modelling , Sound, Animation, Game Engine, texturing, image editing,legal licenses. you need creativity, ideas,logic,creativity,patience,staying power.
And if you work like crazy, you create a small! Game. 
i have developed 2 Games TinyparkVR (first) , Complex(second) and learnd a lot. BothVR. Now i developed another. 
i learned, people dont understand how much, much,much,much work it is to develop a game. what all can go wrong there. Or you like your own game, but the other people do not like it. 
Or the is good ,but the others do not find you , or your game, and so the sells are low. And is there still somthing not perfect , Reviews are merciless.people want a perfect product for a small price. few are considerate and forgive small mistakes.I do it because I enjoy developing something myself. To be able to say that is mine. Of course every amateur / indi developer hopes for commercial success.Your videos are always very helpful. Especially in the adventure Unity Engine. THX; #protectthepineapple; Tbh I never thought this channel will reach 600k; Might not be the best place to ask.....
I'm wondering how i might go about calculating the impact force of a collision. I have an object with a health bar, and i want this object to lose a certain amount of health when it collides with another object. The amount of health it would lose would depend on how hard the collision is. Any ideas would be great! Thanks; The Stanley Parable was one of the most unique games I've played in a long time! Glad to see it made a cameo in the video :D; Tanks for all videos

please make a video for Unity Inventory system for android; when you said you get a player and a goal at the start, i usually start out with some ideas, and try to make them reality before doing much more.. currently i m working on customizing the weapon script you helped me make(using a youtube video, he did not personally help me) so it can do all the things i want it to. so far so good, after that i am going to work on a health system, and maybe some kind of ai, that can shoot at me(to test the health system) and after that, making some kind of level, better than my current test level(tall walls you cannot climb, and a few objects inside to interact with) and then i start working on the important part, getting the main parts of the game made(goals, objectives, whatever); Hey Brackeys,
Considering the fact that the SPIDERMAN PS4 game is wrecking good, it would be a good idea to make a video series on how to make such a "Story Mode" game.
Thank you.; the most basic possible idea of a game is that the player is given a challenge and must overcome it. in game design, you build off of that; hey brackeys how about making a mobile game tutorial series; Very useful vid. Any chance you could do a tutorial showing how to make a basic inventory for a mobile game, so little on mobile games, I'm a noob to all this, so thanks for all of your efforts making tutorials :); Brackeys you are my idol and I like your videos and it inspired me to start an Indie game studios and make a channel to keep track of my progress give me a feedback of my games and Unity tutorials; rip demonitization; This video kicks ass, thank you; Hay buddy check this https://youtu.be/ev2oqWM_na0; I want to start making games, with what do I start with?; Hello; NICE!

Dammit; brackeys cong for 600k sub 🎆🎆🎆🎉🎉🎉; Man. truly thank you so much for this video or tutorial or tip. Can i have a personal favor. Could u just download my game and let me know. How is the look of the game. Because i already know that i failed on game play.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.porkaalam.ferriswheel; Why don't you publish videos everyday? You are more than awesome.; Thanks for the great video Unity Jesus; DON'T SPOIL HALF LIFE! I still need to finish it!; 1:11 Post-ad content. :P; Do-a-nieuw/different-tower-defense; I do wonder how exciting those AAA open world games would be stripped off their amazing graphics, just reduced to the gameplay.; Can you make a game like GTA VC in Unity?; how much coding is there in game design??; ​ @northremembers5455  i honestly don't know,; @North Remembers  coding isn't that hard, but there isn't as much as in.. programming. Game design is also a very broad thing, and it isn't just one single block; Probably because to have this kind of quality, they spend atleast 20-30 hours of work on every single video.; Yeah but he is not alone. He himself told that some of them helps him on video editing. He only focus on recording the video and others edit them. His videos  are  very helpful for every game developers. What do you think of it?; Yeah, that's true, but it still takes a lot of time. However, 2 videos per week is what I would expect from him (them), but probably he has other projects to work on. I really like what he's doing, he reaches and teaches a lot of people, which is a quite honorable thing. His style is also outstanding. So yeah, we owe him a lot.; Great video! Loved all the little bits and jokes!; I started the same way you did the only difference is I started when I was 11 and I’m 13 now; Please can I know how to make a PasueMenu through an icon on the screen...I made it but through a keyboard key

No thanks, bruv. I have you and Derek Banas to hold hands with in my journey. Keep up the goood work.

Cheers; Brackeys please teach us how to create Tutorial Sequences for our game. I really need it really really soon.; Is there a tutorial about creating an inventory like in The Room game?; i'm ios developer but i watch your videos and i don't know why :D i think im interested in game developement; hey man please make videos about making games (playlist) not these shits; Yesterday i was searching for game designing videos on your channel and you do not have that video and found it uploaded just a couple of hours it's coincidence; Thnx for the advice; Pls more videos like this! This was amazing!; Can you continue your 2D tutorials? A weapon equip and secondary weapon switch system?; Problem: bombs make your videos non-ad friendly
Solution: exploding pineapples; Kor sub plz...; You've got WAY to much time on your hands lol. Pineapple 🍍; the fact that he censor the word bomb is so sad. Just look what our world has become. when you not even can say the word bomb. Just because you have to fear that someone feels offended..; udemy rip; well that's not really true. with a course you've got interaction and you learn in steps from the beginning in stead of learning from a random youtuber with a random video..; He has a bunch of videos on inventory systems. https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys/search?query=inventory; i mean f u ck things; sonicjason255 Bloons tower defense has entered the chat; or combustible lemons!; He also avoided saying "Terrorists" and said "attacking team". Honestly, YouTube is still a thing only because there's no decent competition rn.; When did he talk about a bomb?; I feel offended by your comment, sorry but i have to report you; YT should also start demonetizing videos in which comments contains prohibited words.;  @PumpReactivationProject  we are slowly getting there. Just look at the recent "child p*rn" fiasco because one moron claimed that there are pedophile rings or what not what and that caused many advertisers pull away from youtube (again) bringing the addpocalipse 2. That made youtube decide to demonotize videos or maybe even take them down (I'm not sure about the later one) based on the comment sections as a temporary solution. I wonder how temporary it will be.; It's not because people would be offended. Believe me, probably no one would. It's just that YouTube could pick up bomb or terrorist, and demonitize him.; Blazertron oh there’s definitely people that would get offended. Probably not anyone watching this video but there’s always someone offended by anything;  @Sinnbad21  its not about people being offended, its about companies that advertise on youtube THINKING that a video with totally normal words in it is risky to be terrorist propaganda/some shitty youtuber like logan/not viewer friendly and they dont want their ad connected to that video. its somehow understandable but its way over the top;  @kshproductions7996  Youtube doesn't demonetize videos for fun. Since YouTube has got so big, advertisers started noticing the controversial videos that can be found on the platform. Any controversial thing and advertisers don't want their ads on the platform. YouTube wants ads to get money and pay the creators. So YouTube has to censor. As you see it's not as easy as "YouTube bad who cares about the words bomb and terrorist"; well, no, no one's actually getting offended, it's because of youtube's advertiser-friendly policies;  @peoduction6068  The advertisers have no other large video sharing site to go to though, if YouTube just stopped caving to their childish demands of keeping everything pure and inoffensive, then they'd quickly realize they'd still have to advertise on the site if they want their products to be seen.;  @Admiral_Jezza  I've never thought about it that way, you're probably right; Mathews Motta this; Csgo in thumbnail + brackeys, made me click; 6:05 Very LoL xD; Make a tutorial in realistic breaking glass😞; Pineapple...😂✌; Have you studied programming or so?; I'm not sure I want 200 employees under my skin.

Farmers win; I really want to get into design but I just can’t seem to get terrain building right in my games because my PC just isn’t strong enough to build in unity and I’m too poor to build a better PC... rip; @Brackeys , I purchased the course you mentioned in your intro! So far it is pretty great and I would highly recommend the course to beginners and someone like me who has some prior knowledge but is looking to refresh/grow their knowledge on C# and Game Development. They also have a Discord channel which is great for connecting with other people who are looking to learn and advance their skills in this field. Feel free to reach out to me as well with any questions you might have! I love to help out others and learn as much as I can.; Got demonetized!? XD shouldn't have said bomb XD; I love pineapples.; Fun cheats:
-In Bioshock, when the player recieves lethal damage, he gets a few seconds of god mode, leading to more "barely survived" moments.
-In Gears of War, the last bullet in a magazine deals 3x damage, leading to more "barely defended myself" moments.; Different approaches to the talk about the same subject imo, nothing bad about it.; I use adblocker, so I don't feel your pain lol sorry; That's awesome. Anyone have more of those?;  @jangohemmes352  in some games the health bar of the player empties faster when you're at full health and slower when you're almost dead to give you the same feeling of barely survived;  @peoduction6068  neat!; Games Cheat! :O; In Portal when don't shoot the portal in the precise spot, it changes its position for you of a bit 👌;  @peoduction6068  Is that how the Photoshop Flowey fight works?; You watch gmtk as well huh; That's kind of lame.;  @peoduction6068  Doom is known for this, weighted health under certain %; "hard" games just dont use these things, i believe; ​ @ActuallyRocatex  Some game also cheat to make themselves feel hard. Like Doom 2016 and Eternal - Health above about 30-50% gets damaged alot quicker than below that. That's to evoke the "OMG OMG OMG IM ALMOST DEAD, THIS IS HARD" feeling.; In bioshock 1 if an enemy spots you, it will fire a shot that automatically misses to give you the "Oh shit, you thought you caught me you cheeky npc" feeling;  @peoduction6068  it’s like the inverse of iPhone battery bars :); More fun facts: Wile E. Coyote time is a real thing that you can use to often identify a good platform game vs a poorly made one. Which is to say, good platformers will give you a grace period from the time you walk off the edge of a platform, and when you can initiate a jump (or the first of a multi-jump) to aid players who swear they hit the jump button in time but pressed jump a fraction of a second too late.

In short: You're probably not as good at 2D platformers as you think you are. And as someone who has witnessed it firsthand on multiple occasions across multiple games... neither am I. lmao;  @jangohemmes352  Take a second to do a real quick search on "Wile E. Coyote time in game design" to see why you're not as good as you think you are at last minute jumps. 😅
PS: Neither am I, as I've witnessed it firsthand after learning about it.;  @thomasfalcon6350  Not really. Games have been cheating in your favor ever since it became clear that the master-class difficulty of coin-milking arcade machines wasn't appropriate for perpetual licensed games you play on your own time.

Only reason it's "kind of lame" is because up until now, it's been invisible to you.
These "cheats" aren't there to make you substantially better at a game you're shit in though. They're there to aid in horrible human perception of how strictly logical computer code is.

For example, the human mind is horrible when it comes to actually predicting ACTUAL percentages. So more often than not, displayed percentages are fudged to more appropriately match what you expect. For example, a lot of RNG mechanics in games will hot-lock to set percentages that don't match what's displayed. How it's locked often leans heavily on whether it's a good or bad thing and the design decisions made on how the player should feel about it.

For example, in a lot of games, a 90% chance or higher means between 98 to 99% chance because you (and myself too) are horrible at recognizing that a 90% chance of success means a 10% chance of failure. So most games just hand you the success when the "promised" effect is high enough that our dumbasses stop accepting a loss as a possible outcome. Same with debuffs. a 10% chance of something happening against you is actually less than 1% in most cases, again, because a 90% chance of success to our dumb little monkey brains, translates to "sure thing."; Lovely little details; Borderlands second chance feature is another good one.; Invincibility frames;  @Williamatics  thats how every single fight in undertale works, although there is actually a potential in-world explanation for this: Determination.;  @IschmarVI  I forgot I made that comment; laughing out loud!; Also in bioshock, your enemies will always miss their first shot, so you don't get unfairly killed by an unseen enemy.; 4:40 Did you really put Half Life 2's ending straight up in the video, without any spoiler alert? I know the game is old but still...; Can you guys make a video on level/ player selection, that would be really cool. Amazing video as always.; Great video!

It may be overwhelming for someone just starting out. But actually, you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these, but mentioning important aspects of each. For example, the part of rules and the events in the game was great, and even though it seems obvious, i never thought about that. I don't make games myself though, but i find game making incredibly interesting, and difficult.; " 5:43 " When mum calls you , to eat SNACKS.; Ur content is really evolving too be great, really enjoyed this type of video, mayby do more about like basic principles of game design in general instead of only unity tuts (dont stop with the tuts though :P); Another amazing video from Brackeys. :D; Successfully plant the Pineapple XD.; Coding your own games is easier than you think... skip ad; thanks i'm off to make call of duty 16; From my point of view I consider almost a Game is simply/mainly about THE GAME which is mainly made of gameplay and game-feel, to be always constrained by 3 layers almost equivilant to the foundation pillars you mentioned, which are Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics noting that Mechanics are the core base of such pyramid.

Aesthetics indeed are important but note that as much as they should look/feel good, they also must function good as a layer which add more depth to the mechanics layer throughout game dynamics layer: for instance, check Splatoon a great game made by Nintendo, or Minecraft as a more known case here, the mechanics + aesthetics merge to generate a very dynamic game experience and set a unique well themed game tonality.

In my openion, GAME DESIGN is about the process as any other kind of design and not only the objective, yet I agree that to do so an objective is mostly required but note a game like Tremble Run or Piano Tiles: I hate the fact such games being mainly dependent on Skinner boxes, and lacking a gameplay depth but still are defined as games with no defined winning condition, yet only losing condition.


Game objectives aren't everything, yet are important in many cases; however, I appreciate the way you conducted the topic.

!HERE IS A CHALLENGE!

Can you design/develop a game in which losing is winning, while winning is losing; in other words, can you make a game which you must win to lose and vice versa!!?

Doing so maybe illustrate my point that a game is not as much about the objective as it is about  process to be defined by the three layers I mentioned earlier!!; From the thumbnail I thought this was a Mark Brown video XD; I love your videos! And that's why it's so heartbreaking to realize that I can't support you guys in Patreon even if I want to :<; Still waiting for the billboard tutorial please; I love you Brackeys.

You probably just demonetized his video.; Mark Brown has a new competitor? 

This was by far my favorite video! Really well made and quite interesting :D; Honestly, the level with that hovercraft thingy in Half-life 2 was not there for 'pacing' reasons. It was an area made specifically larger to allow for some vehicular physics. There isn't a real change in game pace necessarily. In fact, I think pacing in games can literally be anything, as long as the game remains engaging or maintains focus (yes, this includes cutscenes that are just the right length and/or intensity). Most games that 'lose' me on a playthrough have too much 'down time' in terms of new things occurring or basically anything interesting happening or being able to interact with. I think the number one thing in game design should always be "What keeps gamers engaged in our game experience (and why)?". (engaged here means 'encourages the player to keep playing voluntarily', it doesn't mean 'grinding') I think Counterstrike 'works' mostly just for being a multiplayer team dead match experience (the bomb stuff merely changes up where the action will be focused on the map), where shooting the enemy requires skill and patience, along with how failure to do so results in the 'spectator penalty', instead of a respawn. Remaining alive is all the more rewarding. It's literally one of those games that rewards skill and mastering Counterstrike is not exactly easy. Having said that, even Counterstrike has plenty that will bore most players sooner rather than later. Levels within a playthrough don't change much, and honestly you will use a lot of the same weapons over and over. Keeping an experienced player interested in playing more than say 50-100 hours with that is pretty unlikely. The latter is with solo multiplayer in mind, not a player that joins an active clan. Obviously in such a case a player may end up playing many hundreds of hours of what is already an extremely familiar experience. It should be no surprise some of the biggest games ever in terms of players and play time have an extremely strong focus on multiplayer or co-op / party experiences.; If you guys liked this kind of content, you should really check out Mark Brown's channel.  He's amazing.; It's so great to see you talk about game design, I really think you should make a separate video about each one of those themes. I see a lot of developers that know how to make games but don't really know how to make them fun, and if you can teach them that, you'll be one step ahead of pretty much every channel like yours.; 0:37 my heart skipped a beat, i have not seen that screen for years :(; I need help to learn to get started with unity with codeing and all of it; references TD games

Thank you Brackeys!; You play csgo; It's high time you did a tutorial on GUI and how to make the ui fit different mobile screen.; Remember the time when Brackeys would upload a video regardless of whether they were sponsored or not? Different times...; do a survival game; Games Are Art; And now I go back to CS:GO and plant my pineapples. xDD; I love ur channel; omg now we have the coding your game is easier than you think infecting brackeys; Rule #1: Work with your players, not against them.; i realy love games and programming but i cant get in to design and im not much of a person with a lot of designer friends ya know but i realy want to develop my game but without the design ability or people to help me with that i get stuck. What would be your advise to someone like me?; Player communication appeal focus anticipation logical rules 4 the game(cheating as long as players don't notice) progression objective environment; Amazing :b; Do you think "game design" (you do it this way) constrains creativity? It gives you a box to think in.; The channel name is "Mark Brown", Game Makers Toolkit is the series. It's a really good channel.; James Aylward cheers!; Mark Brown omg hello; Hey you're awesome!!!
I'm a game dev student and I love your videos :D; Snoman Gaming is also really great. There's a number of awesome game design channels out there. And you truly learn a lot by watching their videos as well as thinking critically about the games you play. (That last bit is important, mind you. :) );  @adribier  Can I ask where you're studying? I'm interested in studying game dev too. Salutations from NorCal :);  @ThePC007  Meh. I always thought his analysis were pretty good, until the day he made a video saying NES games are all kind of bad by default.




And no, it's not because I'm a precious little snowflake that got offended because someone talked shit about something I enjoy. It's because most of what he said on that video was objectfully wrong, like calling NES limitations "glitches", and using freaking Megaman 2 and Ducktales as examples of "bad games with bad game design". Megaman 2. One of the  best games ever made.


So he basically jeopardized my entire trust in his opinion. If he told me something was good or bad before, I would totally take his word for it, now I just can't help but second guess every game he ever called a "bad game with bad game design" before.;  @danielbueno8474  Well, I didn't say I agreed with everything he said, just that I enjoy his commentary (you're of course still supposed to make up your own mind about things, rather than just copying everything other people say, of course). What about noclip? He takes his time to make videos, but I think they are also pretty great. His latest one where he let his non-gamer wife play games without "understanding the language of video games" was pretty insightful.


EDIT: Stupid me got noclip and Razbuten mixed up, lol. They're both great channels, though. ;); shameless plug for myself for the videos i am making on design and augmented reality :D;  @ThePC007  let me know if mine offers any value and in how i can improve if you want!; If only you take the online course XD; yEs It Is.; Division Zero i would say yes; made me laugh hard

        Wiggle; tru xD; tru xD; 😂you know you should take this online unity course on Udemy; Thank you good sir;  @Kanal994  I can do this all day long.; well im 17 and i taught my self how.  two months in and i got a game with 2000+ lines of code... how ever i pretty much stole every sprite i use.  


don't worry i won't publish it;  @Felix-lk3xg  wut only 2000+? What engine?; Luuuulllzzzzzzz; AHHHHH. That guy haunts me. Every single video I watch!!!!; Nope, it is way harder than you can imagine (I'm not talking about making a game for mobile, with one ball rolling on the ground);  @shimmentakezo1196  are you replying to me or? If you are, I'll let you know it was a reference to an annoying ad.;  @divisionzero715  Yes I thought it was a real question XD;  @shimmentakezo1196  Well, it's a joke xd, but going off your initial point, I agree. The learning curve hits you like a truck if you come unprepared lol;  @divisionzero715  Yes, but all over the net you can find people saying it is easy;  @shimmentakezo1196  Yeah, liars saying it lmao; Nope! As a game designer, it's a lot harder than you think especially animating them. Trust me.;  @newkiller4457  I know, i'm a dev myself. It's a reference to an obnoxious ad from a couple years ago.;  @divisionzero715  Yeah, but at least you get to enjoy and love the work you do.; y e s;  @Felix-lk3xg  just make sure you design it so sprites are easy to swap out. You never know when you wrote “the one”.; Who doesn't ? i mean it's probably the most famous FPS competitve game out there; He already made a toutorial on UI, and you can just use a canvas scaler to make it fit on mulitple different screens.; Or make Dark Souls

Edit: or become EA; worldofleveldesign.com; I bought a book about basic level design, it helps me a lot.

"Level Design dla początkujących" - Jacek Wesołowski

But i don't know if other language versions exist, beside Polish. Maybe you will find a good alternative. Ask some Dev communities what do they recommend.; No way around it bro. Can't really give substantial advice bc I was particularly better at design and really bad at logic. But I learned how to be good at designing by literally copying copying copying. Until I got better.
Here's a little outline on how you should practice:
1. Find a unique piece of artwork/game/UI/concept art everyday(if you want to practice everyday)
2. Copy
3. Rinse and repeat.

There's some wonder about copying and I think it should be studied more with pedagogy too. You get a lot of insights from just literally copying. It's like not knowing how to solve a math problem and when you write it down your brain usually catches up and gets how things went where.

Best of luck!; take some examples from games that u've enjoyed, and make a small game based on that 

i guess? :v; I'm currently reading Level Up! by Scott Rogers (second edition). I'm still towards the beginning but iti does look interesting. There are plenty of other good books about Game Design but this one is apparently more pratical and less theoretical.

You can read, for starters, but will come a time you will have to go and design/make a game.

You will fail, of course, but as in IT, the good thing is to fail fast and often, you will eventually end up with something not too crass.

But the first one is hard, for sure, still stuck there myself. :P; Thanks guys for all the comments i'll check those books, maybe i get inspired idk.; My tip would be to copy or replicate a design from a game (with a reasonable scope) and then add any touch you would want to see in your game. As mentioned, you really cant avoid design in creating a game but you also don't need to be innovative with the design. Many game companies "copy" from each other  because of what the community enjoys and want. Look at PUBG and Fortnite.  Fortnite is almost the same game as PUBG with the difference of being able to build and have a different graphic approach.;  @jesse2535  Drive and determination. I'm learning code for this very reason, because no one else around me has any drive or follow through. So I took to the words, hard doesn't mean not doable, and those words keep pushing me. One step forward, one step at a time.; Try a variety of different resources, don't just go to one Youtube channel (cough Mark Brown cough) and think that you suddenly got all of the knowledge and expertise on game design. Read books, articles, post-mortems of designers themselves or videos from different channels. However keep in mind that with so many resources on the Internet, you're bound to find a lot of stuff that's just straight up BS so try to look at stuff that's curated (zeef.com is a good website for that)

Also realize that making/designing games is an iterative cycle: test, fail and try again over and over. Even the greatest/talented designers had to do this to get to where they are now. It's good to be critical, but don't be too hard on yourself at the start.

Good luck!; Kat Cut:
I'm also mainly programmer. Most of the times I start working on a game, I don't have a clear enough goal, so I create an engine, add many features and have no idea, how to make a game out of that.
I also often think, I need people to help me. But when not knowing exactly what is needed, it's difficult to find people to help.
I would recommend creating a plan of a simple game, where you either know, how to achieve the task yourself or you can ensure, other people can easily join your project.
For example, you could create some simple game play (graphics, physics, controls, some possible goals) and then find people to draw character images, build levels, write a story.
The game I currently have in mind is just a visual novel with some 2D exploration sequences, so the story will be the focus. The programming is simple and most of the other tasks can either be given to other people or I could do them myself. Since I don't have complicated world mechanics, there is no need to find someone to build proper levels with them.
If you want me to help you or want to team up with me, feel free to contact me (preferably Email Krapohl.f@gmx.de).; attend nearby game jams you will socialise and make designer friends. Making games is hard, only if you take the burden of doing it all on your own. You dont need to be involved with everything to make a good game. Just focus on what you are good at and the rest will appear. Im working on a table top simulator that allows you to create your own stories and allows you to assign game master roles and player roles to fill your story. Doing everything in unity. Im a programmer / designer so I can handle both but I rely more on coding because solving problems never gets boring. So far its just me, because if you want to achieve something do it on your own but if you want to go far do it with others. Anyway just start somewhere and eventually you will see a path; wanna join in the global game jam??? I need a programmer :D;  @rommybarriga3590  ye I'm taking part... It's just me because my friends bailed on me. Hoping to make an interactive fiction game; Average programmer be like; The question is, if the game you're making should be exciting only to you, or for a bigger audience. If it's only for you, then go ahead, and don't even think about those guidelines, if not, then they're an awesome tool to understand, what players might feel while playing your game. A good game design also helps designing levels, because you will just know what to add and create.; Yes. But it limits you to making good games. It cuts off all the bad ideas;  @gametune1278  Depends on what you consider good design and bad design. heck, you can simply go the indie route and give the player an incredibly unique experience that subverts from these game design expectations and whatnot. After all, a game in its simplest form is an interactive medium that allows the player the possibility to affect the way of gameplay. And if not given choice, then they are given the gift of immersion.; 0:12 Dies in a video game.
I can do this better; Hold me i'm gonna make the next GTA story; Someone should make a game, what breaks all of these guidelines.; who dislikes these anyway?!; Pineapples has been planted





Farmers win; Elsker jeres videoer, fortsæt det gode arbejde!; now its 3.00 AM here, the question is where am i?; MY GOD, YOUR VIDEOS LOOK SO GOOD, IT LEGIT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A HIGH LVL PRODUCTION STUDIO; one of the most usefull video for me(at least) right now,thanks!; ...along with 200 employees of course! LOL
That's a really good point I just want to tell those who come up like hey so im basically making gta 5 in unity, and ill release it on steam next week; I just hate that my first goal is to have 10€ on my paypal but to do that you need to pay 10€ just for a good advanced guide 😢; Hey Brackeys , I know it's not the right video to ask you this question. But can you give me a tutorial for how to use Unity Remote 5 with android. I tried all tutorials but nothing happens when I press play. I enabled dev options and Usb debugging  but nothing happens.; Pineapples are deadly; 600k!; Am I the only one hearing weird vibrations from time to time? It's very annoying; I want to make a game on making a game that make a game about making a game inside a game that make a game about making a game inside a game that make a game about making a game inside a game that make a game about making a game inside a game; Don't tell ME that I can't make an open world MMO RPG fantasy game on my own in two weeks!!!!; 8:27 Who's a good boye!? Great video as always Brackeys!; Not first but fast.; Brackeys is playing CSGO confirmed!; this should become a meme; LOL. The thing is, he never realised he died, he turned around before.;  @yaseenkhattak1845  absolutely; And then the Dark Souls series were born; classic every game developer motivation; grabs shot gun; Thousands of those exist. They're called objectively bad games.;  @Mr.Adhesive  are they made bad on purpose? Or are you talking about mobile games?;  @PutesValdovas  I mean, yea, some of them probably are made bad on purpose. And no, I am not saying all mobile games are bad. There are many great mobile games actually.; @Ostrich160 that is kinda paradoxical because many TERRIBLE games actually have a ton of youtube videos made on them because of how bad they are.; The point is, a terrible game with "no appeal" may have appeal in the fact that it HAS no appeal.; Lmao; If only that is the sound FX, then I can play CS in an airplane without worrying my headphones plugged out when the "pineapple" is planted.; have*; Comment of the day!;  @thessalonikiosmusv  you play with bots?; Citymen defeat 16-2; lmaooo; Pizza loses.; someone has to make a counter strike ripoff called pineapple planter simulator 2002 with 2002 graphics; LMAO; It's funny considering some Mario games (correct me if I'm wrong) have bullets or bombs as characters or weapons.; They fight against.... counter-farmerists?;  @bLedq  meat-eaters; https://youtu.be/HM-gPzJIZT4; XD; Hello, world; lol; But not farmer, more like gardener; On a pizza?😂😂😂😂; Hello Sykoo; Don't you dare tell me that I can't do better than gta 5 in 2 weeks! J.K.
Guys, keep it simple and finish it.; Also with multiplayer, extra weapons, zombie mod of course, New mechanics, and battle royal mod.; if one person would try to make all the props form GTA 4, he will need at least 5 year of hard work...; It's possible to make AAA games in terms of graphics and scope with a solo or small team. Though 200 employees helps it go faster, for sure.; hey so im basically making gta 6 in unity...; Correction: on Steam on Playstore.; please make complete turtorials; hey Sam , please  make A video On  {(_Animator) , (_Character_controller)}; Well, Gta 5 had 900+ people working on it; ArcadiaCv Let’s say you start today to make your own GTA 5 with your team of three. As said before, the original game took 4+ years to be made, with a team of 900+, so by the time you finished your game, you’ll have created a game with graphics that were really good back in 2013, but now it’s 2028 and your game is not even looked at by most gamers because it’s just too sh*tty; Where did you get you keyboard?; ...btw I don't know how to program it and how to do 3d models either gg; I'm
I'll*; @Ostrich160 it's*;  @gab_gallard   ya buddy;  @prenomnom2253  that isn't at all how solo and small development teams work. You work with developer art for as long as you can while you make the functionality so that the final result does look up to par with more current workflows. For instance I know a few games in development that moved over to lwrp simply because they had no art yet that was set. Effectively they get the absolute best graphics out of unity despite being older and ongoing projects.
There are many other ways to keep up with AAA games as well... Such as controlling scope or using workflows that take advantage of more procedural content.
5+ year big solo/indie projects almost never turn out "sh**ty" because they basically never get that far along to begin with if they are as bad as everyone thinks. Hello games had 16 employees when they made no man's sky for instance. It got tons of crap for being unliked, but also made nearly $50 million despite using heavy procedurally generated content.;  @CouchFerretmakesGames  
I did. But I ended up with the exact same thing every big game has. So I looked for ways to make it more responsive and feel good, then when that was done.... i'm fucking stuck for days getting ONE GOD DAMN VARIABLE!
I'm using Character Controller and all I want is a float of positive or negative value when turning.
But all I find is Quaternion.Abs or using a ? methods to check if it's more than 180 then i'l take it minus 360 but that's just not stable at all to jut have one damn variable to make the player tilt then rotating DX everything else is solid;  @magnusm4  Hey, yeah rotation stuff are a bit tricky. You could measure the delta rotation in every frame by subtracting the last frame's rotation from the current frame's. And based on this delta rotation you could tilt the character. (If I understand it correctly). Degrees are not the best solutions usually, all game engines use Quaternions because they are stable and easy to work with (for machines, not for us).; make gta 6 and free to play pls; Lol, that was hilarious, you know its folks who are ignorant about the process that say that.
Graphics wise, its a dead end, On the programming side?. Kind of a fairy tale, one thing that keeps me going is I can't see how what I'm striving for won't work no matter how difficult it seems, I only look for amazing and insane compromise(Legendary shortcuts) and they do show up then I press the turbo boost and kaboom!. So for GTA 5, I bet in 2years I can beat that, but its not worth it going solo, a large team is absolutely necessary.; I'm making A TR remake, Crystal Dynamics style...; Thats the "its just a phase mom" of game design; Sooo anyway

I made fortnite in unity;  @aitorrandez  Even more. GTA games take a long time to be finished and released, even with the amount of employees at Rockstar Games.; So you work on games with other people not just yourself?; Depends what you mean by GTA5, you can certainly make a city, traffic, a 3rd person shooting mechanics, driving, even flying in Unity by yourself no problem. As for the rest, things like original AAA quality assets, characters, cinematic voice acting, music, sounds, tightly choreographed story missions, well yes, a $200 million budget and a team of 1000 people would help.; @Danny BRITZMAN Ouch My Lungs.... I cant stop laughing; hey so I am basically making GTAV In Unity And ill release it on steam next week LOL; hey so I'm making GTA 5 in unity, and I'm release it on steam next week.; https://youtu.be/HM-gPzJIZT4; So mmm yeah - that's me. But I never had any illusions about being done in a week. I am about a year in now, and it's starting to look good.; 100 percent science based dragon mmorpg; @Danny BRITZMAN sounds pretty cool, can I help? I can do the UK for you, especially London as I live here.

Maybe make use of google maps server. I am pretty sure that they make it available to everyone bar like area 51 photos and so on..

could use a mixture of their satallite photos, contour data and maybe just design certain buildings that you can access at first and then build apon them as time goes on.; It took me like 2 months to make a simple game where you are a cube dodging obstacles (it has 15 levels, an endless level, and 3 bonus levels); how about just making the city in gta? with just the size of a small fps game map; its possible if you are a genius, but not in a terrible engine like unity.; .;  @ArcadiaCv  well Gta had 900+ people working on it apparently; Lol😅; Tracomi edit > project settings > enable any device.; I did that nothing happens.; close Unity> close unity remote> open unity remote> open Unity

make sure adb drivers are installed; Look if the phone is connect by PTP mode and dont for MTP; Hey Tracomi, Try this... go to edit>Project Setting>Storage.. and change that to force Internal By default it is external. Hope this will work because I know how it feels when you are not able to play your game in your phone.; ikr, its like the sound gets too loud...; Yeah the mic needs to be better buffered. Clamp was turned off or something; How Channel so game dev tycoon?;  @captainpep3  I believe he wants to make a game, like game dev tycoon, where he can (inside his game) make a game like game dev tycoon that would allow him to make a game like game dev tycoon, and etcetera. So no.; Mr. Adhesive I know I was just saying that game dev tycoon is an inception in itself;  @captainpep3  I gotcha, I was just elaborating on the joke as a whole. No saltiness intended.; Hi Ferret! :); Ohh, hi Cool Man! It's a nice surprise to see you here! ;);  @ericpug9154  NPCs*; CouchFerret makes Games q; CouchFerret makes Games you can; Make it in 10 minutes; Yeah we don't need to.. Its understood; You want a job; You can, see there's 222 ppl that liked your comment. That's quite a decent team 😂; You can't, let's see it.; but... 2 years? with subpar graphics and low CCU?; you can

and its gonna be a shitty one; You could still make a gameslice as a prototype. Just make 2 minutes worth of the typical gameplay. To see if the thing has potential, I guess, to see if it can make money. 
But I´d go for great gameplay over looks any day, so what do I know.; I did within a week; lmao I also want to make a fantasy mmorpg because there is so much stuff you can add to it; u can on roblox; You def. can! quality might however be not what one might expect;  Sterling Archer  Sorry this is a bit late answer. I think Computer science Bachelor is not very useful for someone interested in drawing and writing side of game development, I would argue gaming or even art & writing (for animated movies & tv-shows) specific would benefit you more, since they are very closely related
.
Bachelor's in CS have about 70% bloatware of general studies you will need to have a proper skill-set base to learn more advanced stuff once you graduate and enter the work scene. If you plan on doing game engine, physics or programming side more, then Computer science degree would help you more, since those include a hefty amount of mathematics and physics witch can be crucial in those specific fields. But in Writing/design and art, are pretty much useless, and computer science based Uni usually has close to 0 game design and game 3d art related courses. 
.
A University of Applied science that has a gaming specific line would be the best one, since it also gives bachelor's degree. University is more about research and becoming an expert about the field in general and improving some aspect of the field itself, rather than becoming an expert worker in that field, which University of Applied sciences are more about
.
Also one important point, if you are planning to travel for work into other countries, some countries (like Japan) require you to have at least Bachelor's degree in your field to even apply for a working visa
.
Here is my 2 cents with experience from CS at Univ. of applied sciences, IT at University and Game design in a private college; be more focused on your passion for development and texting your family and friends more than anything else. also taking care of your pets.; Its possible if you start it as small then add new things; I mean….. I technically got one to run in a couple months; anywhere there you said it must have quality or length, so yes you can;  @lilybugged  h o w;  @felinelover9486  Godot engine and a lot of past experience. I’m also a software engineer so that helps; That was so damn cute; bruh; XD; Brackeys Brown; This is actually my favourite channel on youtube right now; Cool; Hey. You probably hate my content but I am giving SO MUCH Effort to youtube but get zero respons. My latest video is my FIRST fortnite cinematic and took way to long to edit, it would really make my day if you went to my chanel and subbed or liked the video or atleast give some feedback... 👌😏; Half-Life 3 confirmed!; Thank you brackeys ive had so much trouble with designing my own games thanks for sharing your knowledge with everyone.; Nice; 0:22 Geez, I always forget you looked like that popular dude in a typical high school film/series just a few years ago... :D
Keep it up! Your videos are both helpful and entertaining. I watch all of them even though I'm absolutely not interested in a topic just for the lulz :D <3; Pls can we have one on sandbox game creation; 50th person WO; Please do more coding stuff!; I'm going to rewatch this so many times; ❤; not first; Awesome video; new vid first; Also, 8:32 I'm shipping Brackey's and the guy with the watch standing in the side of the screen now <3; Sometimes I forget if I come here for game dev knowledge or Brackeys' eyes;  @nxt_tim  I think that's his wife at 8:32; Ask your 200 employees;  @gameworkerty  I'm still in secondary school I work alone;  @umaryusuf12  that's awesome. Glad you're making games. Please seriously consider making something simpler than a sandbox game. Brackeys isn't kidding when he says it takes 200 workers.;  @gameworkerty  Some sandbox games can be simple; Thanks for the advice @Chemtrail Dreams but I'm just trying stuff out for the experience and i believe that if i can take the training in the future i can start my own Rockstar Games;  @umaryusuf12  rockstar designers all learned by making small games. I actually know people who work there.;  @raka7304  sandbox games by definition let you do 'anything' which means you have to make huge numbers of animations, sounds, models.;  @gameworkerty  I guess so, tnx I'll stick to smaller projects;  @umaryusuf12  if I could go back and do it all again I would try to make one game each month with a totally new idea for each game. Anyone who does that for 2 years is going to be an amazing designer.;  @gameworkerty  Yeah I tried to do that but I'm juggling between watching ours of YouTube to learn how to school and most importantly FORTNITE.;  @gameworkerty  In fact I have a quiz game I'll be posting on playstore very soon;  @gameworkerty  sure;  @gameworkerty  Not all sandbox require 200 employee. You can also consider spreading out the feature so instead releasing one huge package, just release them overtime. Altho yeah, making a sandbox game is not an easy task.;  @hamizannaruto  you will regret spending that many years working on one game;  @gameworkerty  Reminded me of bob's games. That did not go so well. I say its possible, does not mean it should be. Will most likely end up like bob's game or yandere simulator, become insane. And that is not even 100% sandbox.

Tho you will need to define sandbox.Sand in android are still sandbox, but can be done easily in a few weeks since it so simple. Any game that is so simple, like algodoo is still a sandbox, because it does not have a goal, you can do anything, and im pretty sure that can be done with only a few people.

And game like minecraft is a pretty big sandbox game, tho it release update overtime. Tho it is a big company now, it started pretty small. 


I was confused when you said sandbox game, because really looking at some sandbox game on android, some of it can be done by a small team. Its a big project that cant be done alone, but small game are achievable, even sandbox game.; Same xD; try to make games instead of rewatch this;
