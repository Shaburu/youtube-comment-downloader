I'm moving to the forest to be a human, thank you.; 11. Robotic girlfriend; You should do real research into hydrogen it is already in use but the thing that is standing in it's way is people that think that electric cars are the future!; I’m sorry but if the out adds in my head I’m done.; ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️; The robots from "I-Robot" like this video.; If man he do everything thing he cannot obtain anything thing for man are going on wrong direction of the future .for they are predict a false future .one day they will understand that eveything is vain .; 💥💥💥; Brain computer interfaces; Ielts; Yeah but right now whole world is struggling to make a covid 19 vaccine; those self driving cars are all myths, we have them in my city and none of that is coming true. you're going to keep wait times under 10 minutes and transport everyone during rush hour with fewer cars? (no)  you add more cars to reduce the wait time, thus creating more congestion.; 👍; Dont make artificial inteligence just dont; Wow; 👍; What potential you see in these cars , aren't they expensive , dangerous , or you have another view point ???;  @slimshady6242  They are not expensive anymore and you can fill them up at a gas station like any other cars and they are less dangerous then electric cars did you see how they can blow up and how they need specialist ways to kill the fire!;  @dpb8780  then do you have any idea why Tesla is not working on it , as Elon said "it is mind-blowing stupid idea" or he is just diverting start-ups;  @slimshady6242  They were yes but here in Europe you just pay a bit extra but you do not have to pay any driving tax plus it costs only 0,25 cents a liter. I have a BMW and a VW that both run on it plus there is still the alternative of driving on natural gas which is very big in The Netherlands. But naturally, it is also that I am an automotive designer and that I would hate a future where you cannot drive a car anymore!;  @slimshady6242  Tesla is not using this technology because it is new an electric car is not new there were cars in the beginning that already drove on electricity and the use of hydrogen would put the status of America in danger!

You are from which country , I am from India;  @slimshady6242  Ever wonder why there are just a few Tesla models?

I rather have a Taj Mahal without wind turbines. And if we look at the trends of now putting electric steps around everywhere! They stand in the way, a lot of them end up being thrown into the water which gives a chemical and polluting reaction!  Plus when those batteries need to be to reloaded they are everything but green! And that is just in Paris could you see that happen in India? That green dream is green if you do not look at where they get the electricity or also all the components that go into the batteries and they need to be replaced so all in all very polluting!;  @dpb8780  what's your occupation , and where you live in usa; 2.

https://youtu.be/3ob3t2a-OME; er... no. Alexa and Siri are not robots. The word "robot" means "mechanical working slave". 
don't make stuff up; lame; They didn't predict Corona Virus? What about The Last Ship? 😏; 2nd viewer...; 1st; Technology Islam; In the future robots in Mars and moon. Robot beside you.; Someone made up the definition for robot. That's why anything exists. It was made. Or created depending on how you like your words.;  @diabloivory1430  you say everything using the most common definition. You could say "dog" to express the concept of a cat, but nobody would follow your new interpretation. The word is "robot" and it has already a well defined meaning.;  @ONDANOTA  sounds like you're projecting. Have a nice day.; But does a ""mechanical working slave" need a physical body? Alexa and Siri both are "working slaves". They are "pure" man-made super-minds. Remember, if it is "mechanical" it was man-made...; 🔪🥄🍴; 1st view; 2nd; First; Boring; 2 nd💙💙; Energy bricks is awesome;
